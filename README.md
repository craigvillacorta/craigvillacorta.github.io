This is the future location of my MERN stack portfolio. Yes, it is currently empty. Hopefully, there will soon be a cool project or two to showcase the awesome skills gained through MIT's Full Stack Development Certificate Program.

For now, you are here because you found this link through a required post that illustrates our use of github, the readme file, and markdown language.

This is a list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

And there you have it.
